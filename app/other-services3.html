                            <h4 class="title">Composite Fillings</h4>
                            <p>A composite (tooth colored) filling is used to repair a tooth that is affected by decay, cracks, fractures, etc.  The decayed or affected portion of the tooth will be
                                removed and then filled with a composite filling.</p>
                            <p>There are many types of filling materials available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.  You and your dentist can discuss the best options for restoring
                                your teeth.  Composite fillings, along with silver amalgam fillings, are the most widely used today.  Because composite fillings are tooth colored, they can be closely
                                matched to the color of existing teeth, and are more aesthetically suited for use in front teeth or the more visible areas of the teeth. </p>
                            <p>As with most dental restorations, composite fillings are not permanent and may someday have to be replaced.  They are very durable, and will last many years, giving you
                                a long lasting, beautiful smile.</p>
                            <p><strong>Reasons for composite fillings:</strong></p>
                            <ul class="normal_ul">
                                <li>Chipped teeth.</li>
                                <li>Closing space between two teeth.</li>
                                <li>Cracked or broken teeth.</li>
                                <li>Decayed teeth.</li>
                                <li>Worn teeth.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4 class="title">How are composite fillings placed?</h4>
                            <p> Composite fillings are usually placed in one appointment.  While the tooth is numb, your dentist will remove decay as necessary.  The space will then be thoroughly
                                cleaned and carefully prepared before the new filling is placed.  If the decay was near the nerve of the tooth, a special medication will be applied for added
                                protection.  The composite filling will then be precisely placed, shaped, and polished, restoring your tooth to its original shape and function.</p>
                            <p>It is normal to experience sensitivity to hot and cold when composite fillings are first placed, however this will subside shortly after your tooth acclimates to the new
                                filling.</p>
                            <p>You will be given care instructions at the conclusion of your treatment.  Good oral hygiene practices, eating habits, and regular dental visits will aid in the life of
                                your new fillings.</p>

                            <p>A crown (or cap) is a covering that encases the entire tooth surface restoring it to its original shape and size.  A crown protects and strengthens tooth structure that
                                cannot be restored with fillings or other types of restorations.</p>
                            <p>Although there are several types of crowns, porcelain (tooth colored crown) are the most popular, because they resemble your natural teeth.  They are highly durable and
                                will last many years, but like most dental restorations, they may eventually need to be replaced.  Porcelain crowns are made to match the shape, size, and color or your
                                teeth giving you a natural, long-lasting beautiful smile.</p>
                            <p><strong>Reasons for crowns:</strong></p>
                            <ul class="normal_ul">
                                <li>Broken or fractured teeth.</li>

                            <h4 class="title">What does getting a crown involve?</h4>
                            <p>A crown procedure usually requires two appointments.  Your first appointment will include taking several highly accurate molds (or impressions) that will be used to
                                create your custom crown.  A mold will also be used to create a temporary crown which will stay on your tooth for approximately two weeks until your new crown is
                                fabricated by a dental laboratory.</p>
                            <p>While the tooth is numb, the dentist will prepare the tooth by removing any decay and shaping the surface to properly fit the crown.  Once these details are
                                accomplished, your temporary crown will be placed with temporary cement and your bite will be checked to ensure you are biting properly.</p>
                            <p>At your second appointment your temporary crown will be removed, the tooth will be cleaned, and your new crown will be carefully placed to ensure the spacing and bite
                                are accurate.</p>
                            <p>You will be given care instructions and encouraged to have regular dental visits to check your new crown.</p>

                            <p>A dental bridge is a fixed (non-removable) appliance and is an excellent way to replace missing teeth.</p>
                            <p>There are several types of bridges.  You and your dentist will discuss the best options for your particular case.  The &ldquo;traditional bridge&rdquo; is the most
                                popular type and is usually made of porcelain fused to metal.  Porcelain fixed bridges are most popular because they resemble your natural teeth.  This type of bridge
                                consists to two crowns that go over two anchoring teeth (abutment teeth) and are attached to pontics (artificial teeth), filling the gap created by one or more missing
                                teeth.</p>
                            <p>Dental bridges are highly durable and will last many years, however they may need replacement or need to be re-cemented due to normal wear.</p>
                            <p><strong>Reasons for a fixed bridge:</strong></p>
                            <ul class="normal_ul">
                                <li>Fill space of missing teeth.</li>

                            <h4 class="title">What does getting a fixed bridge involve?</h4>
                            <p>Getting a bridge usually requires two or more visits.  While the teeth are numb, the two anchoring teeth are prepared by removing a portion of enamel to allow for a
                                crown.  Next, a highly accurate impression (mold) is made which will be sent to a dental laboratory where the bridge will be fabricated.  In addition, a temporary
                                bridge will be made and worn for several weeks until your next appointment.</p>
                            <p>At the second visit, you permanent bridge will be carefully checked, adjusted, and cemented to achieve a proper fit.  Occasionally your dentist may only temporarily
                                cement the bridge, allowing your teeth and tissue time to get used to the new bridge.  The new bridge will be permanently cemented at a later time.</p>
                            <p>You will receive care instructions at the conclusion of your treatment.  Proper brushing, flossing and regular dental visits will aid in the life of your new permanent
                                bridge.</p>

                            <p>Getting veneers usually requires two visits to complete the process, with little or no anesthesia required during the procedure.  The teeth are prepared by lightly
                                buffing and shaping the surface to allow for the thickness of the veneer.  A mold or impression of the teeth is taken and a shade (color) will then be chosen by you and
                                the dentist.</p>
                            <p>On the second visit the teeth will be cleansed with special liquids to achieve a durable bond.  Bonding cement is then placed between the tooth and veneer and a special
                                light beam is used to harden and set the bond.</p>

                                your smile.</p>
                            <p>Because having whiter teeth has now become the number one aesthetic concern of most patients, there are a number of ways to whiten teeth.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Take home bleaching</li>
                                <li>In office bleaching</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Since tooth whitening only works on natural tooth enamel, it is important to evaluate replacement of any old fillings, crowns, etc.  Replacement of any restorations will
                                be done after bleaching so they will match the newly bleached teeth.</p>
                            <p>Tooth whitening is not permanent.  A touch-up maybe needed every several years, and more often if you smoke, drink coffee, tea, or wine.</p>
                            <p><strong>Reasons for tooth whitening:</strong></p>
                            <ul class="normal_ul">
                                <li>Fluorosis (excessive fluoridation during tooth development).<br>
                                </li>
                                <li>Normal wear of outer tooth layer.</li>
                                <li>Stained teeth due to medications (tetracycline, etc.).</li>
                                <li>Yellow, brown stained teeth.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4 class="title">What does tooth whitening involve?</h4>
                            <ol class="normal_ul">
                                <li>Take home bleaching<br>
                                    <p>This type of tooth whitening usually requires two visits.  At the first appointment, impressions (molds) will be made of your teeth to fabricate custom, clear
                                        plastic, trays.</p>
                                    <p>At your second appointment, you will try on the trays for proper fit, and adjustments will be made if necessary.  The trays are worn with special whitening
                                        solution either twice a day for 30 minutes or overnight for a couple of weeks depending on the degree of staining and desired level of whitening. </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>In office bleaching<br>
                                    <p>This one hour appointment will give you the most immediate, noticeable whitening effect . These results don&rsquo;t last quite as long as more gradual whitening
                                        achieved with custom trays, but this option is perfect for last minute whitening needs.Your teeth are treated through the use of a bleaching gel where it is
                                        then exposed to a special type of light that heightens the active ingredients contained within the gel. Your teeth can become up to 8 shades whiter compared to
                                        using just a gel by itself.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p> It is normal to experience tooth sensitivity during the time you are whitening your teeth, but it will subside shortly after you have stopped bleaching.</p>
                            <p>You will receive care instructions for your teeth and trays, and be encouraged to visit your dentist regularly to help maintain a beautiful, healthy, white smile.</p>
