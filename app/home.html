                            <span class="blue">We assess the body as a whole. Often times the cause of pain or an injury extends
                                far beyond just the body part or muscle hurting. Without taking a comprehensive look at
                                your entire self, we would be doing you a disservice in fully helping you heal
                                and preventing future limitations.</span>

                            <span class="blue">Not all diagnoses are created equal. One person with low back pain may
                                have completely different limitations than the next person. Your recovery program needs
                                to be specific to what YOUR body needs and not just the typical exercise program that
                                you can find online to band-aid the real issue.</span>

                            <span class="blue">We get you back to living your best life. Just because your pain decreases
                                or you can walk longer doesn't mean that is enough to get you functioning at the level
                                you want to be. While this often signifies the end of care at your typical PT clinic,
                                we don't stop providing guidance until we help you successfully meet every goal you set
