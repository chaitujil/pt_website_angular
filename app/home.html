                        <span class="blue">We assess the body as a whole. Often times the cause of pain or an injury
                            extends
                            far beyond just the body part or muscle hurting. Without taking a comprehensive look at
                            your entire self, we would be doing you a disservice in fully helping you heal
                            and preventing future limitations.</span>

                        <span class="blue">Not all diagnoses are created equal. One person with low back pain may
                            have completely different limitations than the next person. Your recovery program needs
                            to be specific to what YOUR body needs and not just the typical exercise program that
                            you can find online to band-aid the real issue.</span>

                            or you can walk longer doesn't mean that is enough to get you functioning at the level
                            you want to be. While this often signifies the end of care at your typical PT clinic,
                            we don't stop providing guidance until we help you successfully meet every goal you set
