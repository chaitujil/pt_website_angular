                                    Knee is a complex structure and has several ligaments, muscles and tendons attached to it.
                                    Some of the common knee disorders that leads to pain are meniscal tear, ACL, MCL tear/sprain,
                                    patellofemoral joint pain, chondromalacia patella etc.

                                    Menisci and the ligaments have critical roles when it comes to knee stability and its overall function.
                                    Menisci are also known as shock absorbers which support against excessive motion and rotatory forces.
                                    Ligaments such as ACL , PCL and MCL helps in unnecessary translation of the knee during high performance activities or sometimes just pivoting/twisting too.

                                Ankle is a very complex and strong joint that can bear weight in very dynamic and demanding situations. Injuries can occur through over use or acute incidents.

                                    that is also the reason why the shoulder tends to wear and tear and can cause impingement
                                    of structures like bursa or rotator cuff. Gone untreated, it can lead to rotator cuff tears,
                                    bursitis and chronic pain with other complications.
