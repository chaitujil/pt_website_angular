                        We specialize in treating problems related to pelvic floor dysfunction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The pelvic floor is made up of muscles and other tissues that form a sling from the pubic bone to the tailbone. They help to support the abdominal and
                        pelvic organs and to control bladder and bowel activity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pelvic floor dysfunction refers to a wide range of problems that occur when these muscles are over active and in spasm, and often weak and too tight. The
                        tissue surrounding the pelvic floor organs may have increased sensitivity and irritation or decreased sensitivity, causing the resulting dysfunction
                        seen in children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although millions of children suffer from pelvic floor dysfunction, most don't get the help they need. Typically, children are toilet trained by age 4
                        with only very occasional accidents. After age 4 childhood bowel and bladder dysfunction is considered a major medical problem and greatly
                        affects the quality of life for the whole family.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What to Expect: How Do We Treat?</h2>
                    <p>We meet with each child and their parent/s or guardian initially to get a thorough knowledge of history and current problems. We then do a physical
                        examination, looking at the muscles of the abdomen, legs, back and others we feel applicable to the specific problem. This exam is with an
                        adult present and over clothing. Finally, we consult with the referring physician to develop an individualized treatment plan.
                    </p>
                    <p>Treatment is one-on-one, hands on, with the child dressed and lasts 45&ndash;55 minutes&mdash;in comfortable, private treatment rooms.
                    </p>
                    <p>We work with each child and family member very closely and modify our treatment according to what works best for each individual. We incorporate
                        a holistic approach, looking at diet, sleep patterns, and other behavioral issues that could be contributing to the current problem.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="blue">What Exactly Do We Do?</h2>
                    <p>Treatment includes:</p>
